# CLAnime
A cli video player intended to watch anime (not recommended tho lol)

its a stupid (fun (stupidly fun)) little script i made which is unoptimized, has a lot of bugs, and lacks some features i wanted to include. (also it doesn't solve any problem lol)

here's how it looks in action (2x speed)
